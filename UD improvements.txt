- vanilla jail items removal needs to be patched to avoid dds breaking, similar to MQ107
- Abadon ring, add disease resist, maybe mana regen? Discuss balancing it
- Abadon weapon, in addition to hand restraint following hits should add more restraints, add shader
- develop better procedures to UDRRM to apply random Abadon restraints? Will be useful to the above
- black goo, remove annoying messagebox(limit it to ~3 shows, tie to global variable?), add shader, add additional restraints if hands bound
- add shader to conc black goo and purified one
- fix "increadibly", "unregistred"
- fix hoods being stripped by strip function
- add shader to MAO and MAH and abadon plug manifests
- consider abadon plug improvements, i.e. crits are not used, but generated by plug as self-defence mechanism, also needs to tie helper too
- mind break from AP - maybe when orgasming with AP at 100% it can spend around 66% to apply some mind condition with probability, tied to number of orgasm exhaustions. 
- possible mind conditions: go along the usual modifiers? I.e. highly aroused like gasmasked, MAH, MAO? Add some tattoos to indicate those?
- how to clear them? they should have some strength, with each activation should lose some. Add probablity of activation and of fail? Make it emit black goo? Maybe add some temple services to cleanse?
- audio cues for crits
- random restraints UDRRM improvement allowing suits to be removed for adding straitjackets

- new modifiers, maybe wait till ivanw finishes his pr. 1. Binding helper, 2. Electrocute both wearer and helper(what's better? stagger, ragdoll drop, paralyze like a wood?). Both are probability based.
