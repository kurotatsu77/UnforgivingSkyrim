# UnforgivingSkyrim
Extension to Unforgiving Devices mod by iHateMyKite

Requires DD 5.2 and UD 2.1

WARNING: This is legacy version, will not get new content in the future, only bugfixes, will remain available only for LE users.
All future development will be SE/AE-only.

Added Dasha's items. Added their meshes and textures to package. 

Added 3 suits - Cursed, Boxbinder(uses Abadon Dasha's items) and Random(adds random Abadon items).
Custom outfit set - Bound Cunt (BC).

Draugr Replacers.7z - optional, contains replacers for draugrs with MNC support, courtesy of Audhol. Makes them look nice and shiny!

Currently there is Abadon Shout - complex shout which acts differently depending on who uses is (male or female) and on whom it used (male or female).
Status: working, subtitles made and sounds used are empty ones until I get good ones. Only a thunder when cast at the moment. Good enough for now.
Quest to obtain it will be launched after observing it from draugrs, proceed to actually get it after completing MQ104 (Dragons Rising).
Added it to draugrs high-levels - bosses and scourges (they have Unrelenting Force normally, now Abadon Shout too), they use it! Yesss! If they have other shouts - they use them randomly too, which is nice.
After using someone (player or follower, doesn't matter) males draugrs are happy and will not attack anymore, but will defend themsleves in case of aggression, which I like! Female draugrs being bitches, beating helpless player into submission :)

Known Problems:
Goo Arrows are not working ATM. Trying to figure out why...
Current implementation of USWhip function support whipping of player only, maybe rewrite is some time later... For now added checks to not to call it when victim is not player.

Unforgiving Skyrim Goo Quest - done all initial quest, started by visiting Whiterun area while having Black Goo in inventory and knowing it's first effect. Cell now has all items in, prepared alchemy station and enchant station to be opened by side quests.
Research now works, added overrides to lock almost all crafts behind the research.
Research report has hints to how progress.
Generic ingredients effects are researched too.
Now it is a solid foundation to build bunch of content in form of side quests and repeatable activities.
Added Masochism stat tracking for possible future use in dialogues and events.
Expanded dialogues on the Goo Research Quest to provide better motivation for player to get involved.
Side quest to get Alchemy station done, if player chooses fun payment options - there will be repeatable action with Arcadia.
Side quest to get the DD Book is done, quest for the Urag research sharing is done. It turned out quite big and complicated. Who needs simple and boring, right? :)
Side quest to get the Enchanting Station done. Quest quest uses BC set. Added repeatables with it to 4 NPCs (Calcelmo, Farengar, Arcadia and Urag).

Current ideas in various stages of planning:
Repeatable activity - become bondage entertainment at Bannered Mare  for Hulda.
NPC bondage rescue radiant quest. 
NPC bondage punishment radiant quest: idea of getting orders to punish bad girls by coming to them, binding and leaving them locked at public place (maybe inn?) in stocks or other furniture to humiliate them. And imagine choices player would have if one day she would receive order to punish herself! :D Boring option would be to pay out bounty to the client, maybe with a bit of extra. Fun options would be going through it or even offer more harsh treatment, because gold is good! 
Repeatable quest of small chance for research to fail, which will cause Nodaba to be locked in devices. This will prompt a side quest which will tell the player to return to the house and help her out. Player can ignore it, in which can she have to help herself (hopefully AI will work as intended). But by helping her, there might be some kind of reward (bonus research points, discount on research or just money).
